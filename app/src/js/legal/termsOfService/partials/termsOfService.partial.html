    <p>We have adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ours and/or others.</p>
    <p>Other Users; Release. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do. We do not review users’ postings and (except as may be expressly set out in these terms) are not involved in the actual transactions between users. As most of the content on the Services comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what’s offered. If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
    <p>Disclaimer of Warranties. WE DISCLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING OTHER SERVICE(S) ACCESSED BY THE APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES. YOU DOWNLOAD THE APPLICATION AND USE THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR HARDWARE DEVICE(S) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF THE APPLICATION OR USE OF THE SERVICES. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE OR SECURE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NOTIFICATION FUNCTIONALITY IN THE APPLICATION MAY NOT OCCUR IN REAL TIME. SUCH FUNCTIONALITY IS SUBJECT TO DELAYS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DELAYS OR LATENCY DUE TO YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION OR YOUR WIRELESS DATA SERVICE PROVIDER’S NETWORK.</p>
    <p>Limitation of Liability. We are not liable to you or any user for any use or misuse of the Services. This exclusion: (a) includes direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary and punitive damages, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort or otherwise (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages); (b) applies whether damages arise from use or misuse of and reliance on the Services, from inability to use the Services, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of the Services (including any damages incurred by third parties); and (c) applies notwithstanding a failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy and to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
    <p>Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 US dollars.</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so the disclaimers in the preceding section and the above limitations and exclusions of liability may not apply to you.</p>
    <p>Indemnification. You will indemnify and hold harmless us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) against and from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your conduct, your use of the Services, any alleged violation of these terms, and any alleged violation of any applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations. Security. We reserve the right at our discretion to take whatever action we find necessary to preserve the security, integrity and reliability of our network and back-office applications.</p>
    <p>Changes to the Services or Terms of Use. We reserve the right to make changes to the Services and/or these terms from time to time. Any material changes will take effect when you next use the Services or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. If you do not agree to any change, please uninstall the Application and discontinue your use of the Services. No other amendment to these terms will be effective unless made in writing, signed by users and by us.</p>
    <p>Compliance with Certain Laws. You are responsible for complying with trade regulations and both foreign and domestic laws.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, these terms shall be governed and construed in all respects by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against us must be resolved by the courts of the United States, and you and we both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of San Francisco, California. If we do not enforce any particular provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. If a court strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. We may automatically assign these terms in our sole discretion in accordance with the notice provision below. Except for notices relating to illegal or infringing content, your notices to us must be sent by registered mail to:</p>
